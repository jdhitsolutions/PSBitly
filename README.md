# PSBitly

Create and work with Bit.ly shortcut links from a PowerShell prompt. Many of the commands are based on Bitly's [v4 API Documentation](https://dev.bitly.com/v4_documentation.html). Almost all of these commands will require you to get an API Key or OAuth token under your Bit.ly account settings.
